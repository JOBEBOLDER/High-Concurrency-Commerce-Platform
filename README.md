# High-Concurrency Commerce Platform

A high-performance e-commerce platform built with Java, Spring Boot, and Redis, focusing on solving concurrency challenges in high-traffic scenarios. This platform features optimized solutions for user authentication, merchant management, flash sales, and social interaction components.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 📱 User Authentication
- Redis-based distributed session management replacing traditional Tomcat sessions
- Token-based authentication with automatic refresh
- Secure SMS verification code login system

### 🏪 Merchant Management
- Multi-level caching strategy with TTL randomization
- Delayed double-deletion cache consistency pattern reducing MySQL load by 65%
- Solutions for cache penetration, cache avalanche, and cache breakdown

### 🔥 Flash Sales System
- Redisson-based distributed lock system preventing inventory overselling
- Redis + Lua script implementation for atomic inventory deduction
- Asynchronous order processing via message queues
- Handling 8K TPS during peak flash sale events

### 👥 Social Features
- ZSET-based ranking system for popularity metrics
- Friend relationship management with mutual following detection
- Hybrid push-pull feed stream model reducing content delivery latency by 40%
- Efficient pagination with Redis sorted sets

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Redis Cache Solutions
- **Cache Penetration Prevention**: Empty result caching and Bloom filter implementation
- **Cache Avalanche Protection**: TTL randomization, Redis cluster with Sentinel
- **Cache Breakdown Handling**:
    - Mutex lock approach for consistency
    - Logical expiration for high availability

### Distributed Locks
- Redis-based distributed lock with Lua script for atomic operations
- Redisson implementation with reentrant lock support
- Watchdog mechanism for lock renewal

### Message Queue Patterns
- List-based blocking queue implementation
- Pub/Sub messaging for multi-consumer scenarios
- Redis Stream for persistent, acknowledged message delivery

### Feed Stream Implementation
- Timeline-based chronological content delivery
- ZSET-based scoring and ranking
- Hybrid push-pull model optimizing for different user types

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Java
- Spring Boot
- Redis
- MySQL
- Maven

## 🔍 Project Structure
The application follows a standard layered architecture:
- Controllers: Handle HTTP requests
- Services: Implement business logic
- Repositories: Data access layer
- Utils: Helper classes and utilities

## 📊 Performance Metrics
- 8K+ TPS during flash sales
- 15K+ daily inventory conflicts resolved
- 65% reduction in MySQL load
- 40% reduction in content delivery latency
