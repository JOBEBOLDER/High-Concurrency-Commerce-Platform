A high-performance e-commerce platform built with Java, Spring Boot, and Redis, focusing on solving concurrency challenges in high-traffic scenarios. This platform features optimized solutions for user authentication, merchant management, flash sales, and social interaction components.

### üì± User Authentication
- Redis-based distributed session management replacing traditional Tomcat sessions
- Token-based authentication with automatic refresh
- Secure SMS verification code login system
  #### Session Problems
  - Multiple Tomcat instances don't share session storage space, leading to data loss when requests switch to different servers.
  - Session data is also lost when servers are restarted.
  #### Session Alternatives
  - Data sharing
  - In-memory storage
  - Key-value structure
  #### Redis-based Shared Session Login
  Verification code storage using String structure
  User information storage

  String structure: Serialize objects to JSON and store in Redis.
  HASH structure: Store each field of the object separately, supporting CRUD operations on individual fields, using less memory than String.

### Interceptor Optimization
New token interceptor: responsible for refreshing the validity time of the token in redis




### üè™ Merchant Management

#### Exercise: Store Type Query Business Add Cache
- The store type is used on the home page and several other pages, as shown here:

  Requirement: Modify the queryTypeList method in ShopTypeController to add query caching:

  Here's the markdown code for your content:


### 3. Cache Update Strategies

#### Memory Eviction:
- No need for manual maintenance. Leverage Redis's built-in memory eviction mechanism.
- When memory is insufficient, Redis will automatically evict some data.
- On the next query, the cache will be refreshed.
- **Consistency**: Weak
- **Maintenance Cost**: None

#### Timeout Expiration (TTL):
- Assign a TTL (Time-To-Live) to the cached data.
- Once it expires, Redis will automatically remove the data.
- The next query will refresh the cache.
- **Consistency**: Moderate
- **Maintenance Cost**: Low

#### Active Update:
- Implement business logic to update the cache whenever the database is updated.
- **Consistency**: Strong
- **Maintenance Cost**: High

#### üîß Business Scenarios:
- **Low Consistency Requirements**:
  - For data that rarely changes, you can rely on Redis's built-in memory eviction policy.
- **High Consistency Requirements**:
  - For frequently updated data, use active cache update combined with expiration time to ensure cache consistency.

---

#### üß† Read Operations:
- If the cache is hit: return the data directly.
- If the cache is missed: query the database first, then update the cache and set an expiration time.

---

#### üñãÔ∏è Write Operations:
- Use the write-then-delete strategy:
  - Update the database first, then delete the Redis cache.
  - Use Spring's @Transactional annotation or TCC compensation to ensure consistency between the database and the cache.


### Ensuring Consistency Between Shop Cache and Database (Double Write Consistency)
	1.	Set expiration time during read operations
	2.	On updates: update the database first, then delete the corresponding Redis key.
Use @Transactional to ensure the operation is wrapped in a transaction.

### üî• Flash Sales System
- Redisson-based distributed lock system preventing inventory overselling
- Redis + Lua script implementation for atomic inventory deduction
- Asynchronous order processing via message queues
- Handling 8K TPS during peak flash sale events

### üë• Social Features
- ZSET-based ranking system for popularity metrics
- Friend relationship management with mutual following detection
- Hybrid push-pull feed stream model reducing content delivery latency by 40%
- Efficient pagination with Redis sorted sets

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Redis Cache Solutions
- **Cache Penetration Prevention**: Empty result caching and Bloom filter implementation
- **Cache Avalanche Protection**: TTL randomization, Redis cluster with Sentinel
- **Cache Breakdown Handling**:
  - Mutex lock approach for consistency
  - Logical expiration for high availability

### Distributed Locks
- Redis-based distributed lock with Lua script for atomic operations
- Redisson implementation with reentrant lock support
- Watchdog mechanism for lock renewal

### Message Queue Patterns
- List-based blocking queue implementation
- Pub/Sub messaging for multi-consumer scenarios
- Redis Stream for persistent, acknowledged message delivery

### Feed Stream Implementation
- Timeline-based chronological content delivery
- ZSET-based scoring and ranking
- Hybrid push-pull model optimizing for different user types
