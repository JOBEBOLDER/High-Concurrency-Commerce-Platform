A high-performance e-commerce platform built with Java, Spring Boot, and Redis, focusing on solving concurrency challenges in high-traffic scenarios. This platform features optimized solutions for user authentication, merchant management, flash sales, and social interaction components.

### üì± User Authentication
- Redis-based distributed session management replacing traditional Tomcat sessions
- Token-based authentication with automatic refresh
- Secure SMS verification code login system
  #### Session Problems
  - Multiple Tomcat instances don't share session storage space, leading to data loss when requests switch to different servers.
  - Session data is also lost when servers are restarted.
  #### Session Alternatives
  - Data sharing
  - In-memory storage
  - Key-value structure
  #### Redis-based Shared Session Login
  Verification code storage using String structure
  User information storage

  String structure: Serialize objects to JSON and store in Redis.
  HASH structure: Store each field of the object separately, supporting CRUD operations on individual fields, using less memory than String.

#### Exercise: Store Type Query Business Add Cache
- The store type is used on the home page and several other pages, as shown here:

  Requirement: Modify the queryTypeList method in ShopTypeController to add query caching:

### 3. Cache Update Strategies

#### Memory Eviction:
- No need for manual maintenance. Leverage Redis's built-in memory eviction mechanism.
- When memory is insufficient, Redis will automatically evict some data.
- On the next query, the cache will be refreshed.
- **Consistency**: Weak
- **Maintenance Cost**: None

#### Timeout Expiration (TTL):
- Assign a TTL (Time-To-Live) to the cached data.
- Once it expires, Redis will automatically remove the data.
- The next query will refresh the cache.
- **Consistency**: Moderate
- **Maintenance Cost**: Low

#### Active Update:
- Implement business logic to update the cache whenever the database is updated.
- **Consistency**: Strong
- **Maintenance Cost**: High

#### üîß Business Scenarios:
- **Low Consistency Requirements**:
  - For data that rarely changes, you can rely on Redis's built-in memory eviction policy.
- **High Consistency Requirements**:
  - For frequently updated data, use active cache update combined with expiration time to ensure cache consistency.

---

#### üß† Read Operations:
- If the cache is hit: return the data directly.
- If the cache is missed: query the database first, then update the cache and set an expiration time.

---

#### üñãÔ∏è Write Operations:
- Use the write-then-delete strategy:
  - Update the database first, then delete the Redis cache.
  - Use Spring's @Transactional annotation or TCC compensation to ensure consistency between the database and the cache.


### Ensuring Consistency Between Shop Cache and Database (Double Write Consistency)
	1.	Set expiration time during read operations
	2.	On updates: update the database first, then delete the corresponding Redis key.
Use @Transactional to ensure the operation is wrapped in a transaction.

## 5. Cache Issues

### Cache Penetration
When client requests miss both in cache and database, it's cache penetration.

**Solutions:**
* **Cache Empty Objects**: When no data exists in both cache and database, cache a null object with TTL.
  * Pros: Simple implementation
  * Cons: Extra memory consumption, potential data inconsistency
* **Bloom Filter**: A pre-filter that checks if data exists in cache. Returns immediately if not found, continues query if found

### Cache Avalanche
When a large number of cache keys expire simultaneously or Redis service crashes, causing massive requests to hit the database.

**Solutions:**
* Set different random TTL values for keys
* Improve Redis availability (using cluster solutions with sentinel mechanism)
* Add degradation and rate limiting strategies to cache services using sentinel
* Set keys to never expire (no TTL)
* Implement multi-level caching for services

### Cache Breakdown
When a hot key is accessed with high concurrency and its cache has expired, countless requests bypass the cache and directly hit the database,
as picture shown:
![img.png](img.png)

#### Cache Breakdown solutions:1,Mutual Exclusion Lock 2,Logical Expiration:
![img_1.png](img_1.png)

#### Cache Breakdown Solutions:

* **Mutual Exclusion Lock Approach**: When multiple threads query data, apply mutual exclusion locks to ensure only one thread can rebuild the cache by querying the database at any given time, while other threads wait:
  * **Pros**: Ensures data consistency
  * **Cons**: Sacrifices system availability - if reconstruction takes too long, other requests must wait. Also carries deadlock risks

* **Logical Expiration Approach**: Add a new logical expiration field to cached data. When a query arrives, first check if the current time exceeds expiration. If expired, acquire a lock and start a new thread responsible for cache rebuilding while immediately returning the old data. Other threads similarly attempt to acquire the lock - if unsuccessful, they directly return the expired data:
  * **Pros**: Better performance, greatly enhanced system availability
  * **Cons**: Additional memory consumption, prioritizes availability over consistency (sacrificing strong consistency). More complex implementation

### üî• Flash Sales System 

- ![img_4.png](img_4.png)
#### Coupon Flash Sale Analysis

#### Pessimistic Lock Approach
Adding synchronization locks to make threads execute serially. Using synchronized or Lock.
* **Advantages**: Simple and direct, applies locks to shared resource objects
* **Disadvantages**: Generally lower performance

#### Optimistic Lock Approach
No locks applied, only checking whether other threads have modified the data during updates. Using CAS version number method or leveraging database row locks with UPDATE statements.
* **Advantages**: Better performance
* **Disadvantages**: Can have low success rates in high-contention scenarios

# Using command to add Redis lock with expiration time

```bash
# Add lock with value, only if key doesn't exist (NX), and set expiration to 10 seconds (EX 10)
set lock value NX EX 10

# Unlock by deleting the key
del lock
```
#### Lua script manipulation of redis to achieve atomic unlock operations
```bash
unlock.lua
-- key
if (ARGV[1] == redis.call('get', KEYS[1])) then
    -- ÈáäÊîæÈîÅ
    return redis.call('del', KEYS[1])
end
return 0
